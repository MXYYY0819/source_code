# Code Reference
```command
If you have used the LACAT project in your work, consider referring to Leurent E. rl-agents: Implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms[EB/OL].(2018)
```

```command
The LACAT used code from Bi X, He M, Sun Y. Mix Q-learning for lane changing: a collaborative decision-making method in multi-agent deep reinforcement learning[J]. IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 2025. LACAT also uses code from the code base https://github.com/pku-smart-city/source_code/tree/main/MQLC.
